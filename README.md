# Canonical Online Services Coding Style Guides

The following style guides should be applied to all new front-end related code.

## Dealing with legacy code

When working with an existing project that doesn't follow the style guide, new code added to that project should conform to the style guide.

To avoid unnecessary refactoring, existing code should generally be left as it is unless only trivial effort is required to get the code into compliance with the style guide. This is left to the best judgement of developer.
